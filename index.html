		<h1>Bruce</h1>
		<img src="images/bruce.jpg"/>
		<p>Bruce was a red tailed black shark who died from accidental poisoning.
			 We were given bad instructions from a store owner on how to properly use cleaning
			  solution for his aquarium. The rapid increase in PH levels caused Bruce to 
			 suffocate within minutes.</p>

		<h1>Captain</h1>
		<img src="images/captain.jpg"/>
		<p>Captain was a yellow lab who died from congestive heart failure. He 
			had been on medication for his condition - it had likely kept him alive
			 for years, until eventually he became too obese for the medicine to take effect,
			and he died suddenly.

		<h1>Tigger</h1>
		<img src="images/tigger.jpg"/>
		<p>Tigger was a red Tabby cat who tended to struggle with obesity. He died the day after Christmas
			when a blot clot to the brain caused him to collapse and have a siezure.</p>
