		<h1>Bruce</h1>
		<img src="images/bruce.jpg"/>
		<p>Bruce was a red tailed black shark who died from an accidental poisoning.
			 We were given bad instructions from a store owner on how to properly use cleaning
			  solution for his aquarium. The rapid increase in PH levels caused Bruce to 
			 suffocate within minutes.</p>

		<h1>Captain</h1>
		<img src="images/captain.jpg"/>
		<p>Captain was a yellow lab who died from congestive heart failure. He 
			had been on medication for the condition. It had likely kept him alive
			 for years, until he eventually became too obese for the medicine to take effect,
			and he died suddenly.

		<h1>Tigger</h1>
		<img src="images/tigger.jpg"/>
		<p>Tigger was a red Tabby cat who struggled with obesity. He died the day after Christmas
			when a blot clot to the brain caused him to collapse and have a siezure.</p>
